# Check if npm is installed

## Retrospective
 - Consider CSS frameworks (**Bootstrap**, **Tailwind CSS**) or SSGs (**Astro**, **Gatsby**) to speed up styling
 - Maybe use JavaScript frameworks (**React.js**, **Vue.js**) for easier DOM manipulation
 - Opt for **GitHub issues** and **pull requests** instead of pushing straight to main for better Git workflow
