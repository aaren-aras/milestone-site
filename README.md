## Prerequisites
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup
```bash

## Retrospective
 - Consider CSS frameworks (**Bootstrap**, **Tailwind CSS**) or SSGs (**Astro**, **Gatsby**) to speed up styling
 - Maybe use JavaScript frameworks (**React.js**, **Vue.js**) for easier DOM manipulation
 - Opt for **GitHub issues** and **pull requests** instead of pushing straight to main for better Git workflow
